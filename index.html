        <h3>mvp+</h3>
        <p>MVP+ is a premium rank on EntityMC that offers several benefits to players who purchase it. As the owners of EntityMC, players with MVP+ have access to exclusive in-game perks such as increased reward rates from minigames, unique cosmetic items, and additional chat features. Additionally, MVP+ users also receive priority queue status, meaning they are able to join the server even when it's at maximum capacity, before non-MVP+ players. Another advantage of purchasing MVP+ is access to the EntityMC Support Team, which provides quick and efficient assistance with any in-game issues. These benefits enhance the overall gaming experience for MVP+ players and make playing on EntityMC even more enjoyable.</p>
